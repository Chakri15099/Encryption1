## Problem Statement
In this project the text is encrypted using the app feature resulting the encrypted text. 
There is a decrypt feature which allows the user to decrypt the text which was previously encrypted.
We face problems in communicating over social media since the data is not secured enough, when it is passed through the network.
There is a chance of data getting hacked. The main aim is to secure the data over social media. 
The proposed system helps in securing the data where the user gets to enter the plain text later selects the algorithm of his choice listed(AES,MD5,SHA-512,SHA-256) and the key is supplied.
Encrypted text is formed which will be sent to the other end user. This process helps us in sending the message securely without interference of intruders.
Once the user encrypts the message, he can send it to the other app user using the userid. The receiver then decrypts the text using the key which is shared by selecting an algorithm.
This process helps us in sending the message securely without interference of intruders. Since the algorithm and key are required to decrypt the encrypted text.

## Steps to use the app
1.Login with the given Test credentials<br>
2.If you are not registered create a new account and then login, You will be directed to the home page<br>
3. Inorder to check the messages go to the view messages button which will display either nowmal messages or encrypted codes which  the user recived.<br>
4. Copy the Encrypted code and click the decrypt button you will be directed to the decryption page. Or you can send a new message <br>
5. Paste the encrypted message here and enter the key that is shared personally. <br>
6. Click the decrypt button to decrypt the coded message. The Decrypted message will be displayed<br>
7. To send a new encrypted message click the encrypted message button which will direct you to the encryption page.<br>
8. Select an algorithm of your choice among the provided algorithms.<br>
9. Now enter a message you want to send and assign a secured key to it.<br>
10. Click the Encrypt button to make your message into an encrypted code.<br>
11. Copy the code and click the send button to send it the other user, you will be directed to send page.<br>
12. Paste the encrypted code in the given box and enter an existing username whom you want to send the message and click send.<br>
13. The message will be sent. In the reciever end to check the messages go to the vieew messages card and follow the 4,5,6 steps mentioned above.<br>


## Advantages
Move data Securely<br>
Supports data integrity<br>
Security across multiple devices



## Activities
Encryption and Decryption : Encrypts a particular message and sends it to the other person and later we can Decrypt it.
