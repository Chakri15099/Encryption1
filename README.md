## Problem Statement
In this project the text is encrypted using the app feature resulting the encrypted text. 
There is a decrypt feature which allows the user to decrypt the text which was previously encrypted.
We face problems in communicating over social media since the data is not secured enough, when it is passed through the network.
There is a chance of data getting hacked. The main aim is to secure the data over social media. 
The proposed system helps in securing the data where the user gets to enter the plain text later selects the algorithm of his choice listed(AES,MD5,SHA-512,SHA-256) and the key is supplied.
Encrypted text is formed which will be sent to the other end user. This process helps us in sending the message securely without interference of intruders.
Once the user encrypts the message, he can send it to the other app user using the userid. The receiver then decrypts the text using the key which is shared by selecting an algorithm.
This process helps us in sending the message securely without interference of intruders. Since the algorithm and key are required to decrypt the encrypted text.
